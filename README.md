BagelGUI
========


This Java program demonstrates a GUI. The GUI program incorporates multiple class interaction, extending the JFrame Class, handling events with action listeners, and outputting a result to a dialog box. The entire GUI is organized with a layout manager. The GUI also utilizes radio buttons and check boxes.

If you wish to download the executable JAR file, navagate to my BagelGUI Release above.
